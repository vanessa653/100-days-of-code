# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Jan 4, 2021 


**Today's Progress**: Picked next project, started creating the Data file the app will use. 

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with publishing my first project. I found several people were having the same issue with github pages and SPAs. Ended up messing up my og files. Putting learn all about GitHub on my todo list, and will try to publish my project again. VS code is having issues with my git extension to many changes, I dont want to add a new repository and these files untill I get the VS code issue resloved.
